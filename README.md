## Introduction
This repository contains MATLAB code for an optimization model designed to improve feed formulations for the black tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon). The code employs linear programming techniques to balance the prawn's nutritional needs with cost efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Shrimp aquaculture faces the critical challenge of providing nutritionally adequate feed while minimizing the associated costs, which are a major component of operational expenses.

## Proposed Solution
The MATLAB code in this repository represents a solution that utilizes linear programming to determine the most cost-effective combination of commercially available feeds, satisfying the dietary requirements of the black tiger prawn.

## System Requirements
To run this code effectively, your system should meet the following specifications:
- **Processor**: AMD Ryzen 9 5800x
- **Graphics Card**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080TI
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 Pro

## Software Requirements
- **MATLAB**: The code has been tested and is intended to be run on MATLAB 2024A.
- **Optimization Toolbox**: This toolbox is required for running the optimization model in MATLAB.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`, and ensure you have the correct version of MATLAB installed with the Optimization Toolbox.

## Usage
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned code.
3. Open the script file.
4. Run the script in the MATLAB command window.

## Results
Upon running the code, you will receive the optimal feed mix that minimizes costs while meeting the nutritional requirements of the black tiger prawn. The results include detailed cost breakdowns and nutritional profiles.
